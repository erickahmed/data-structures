# Stack

A stack is an abstract linear data structure. The order of access is LIFO (Last In First Out).
A stack supports essentially only two operations: push and pop.

### Pro's

It is a very versatile DS, even if it has mainly only two functions. Also you can use it in LIFO or FIFO configurations.

### Cons

The only limitation is that you can work on the last layer of the stack, pushing or popping the element at the top.
