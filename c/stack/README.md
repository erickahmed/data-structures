# Stack

A stack is an abstract linear data structure. The order of access is LIFO (Last In First Out).
A stack supports essentially only two operations: push and pop.

### Pro's

It is a very versatile DS, and having only two main methods to add or remove elements it is very easy compared to other DSs

### Cons

The only limitation is that you can work on the last layer of the stack, pushing or popping the element at the top.
