# Doubly Linked List

Like a singly linked list, a doubly linked list is similiar to an array but doesen't have to be allocated in a contiguous way.

### Pro's

Like SLL, it offers the same features of an array without the disadvantage of having to have be contiguous.
It can be walked in both ways (from tail to head or from head to tail).

### Cons

As for SLL, the only way to access an element in a random point of the list is to start from either the first or last element and iterate through every element until you find the one you were looking for.
Doubly linked lists requires double the memeory overhead since they have to allocate space for double the number of pointers than singly linked lists.
